# TomatoTomato - to do list

To do list with integrated Pomodoro Technique* made in Xcode 14 using Swift UI, SQLite and a lot of my brain cells.

## Main idea
TomatoTomato is designed to help people to track their time at work.
Our target audience is people who just started an IT (or IT-like) job.
I hope to start using it myself when it’s ready :)

## How it works
We are building a to do list integrated with Pomodoro timer. Our users will be able not only write down the tasks but also check how much time they spent on them.  And on the similar tasks in the past. We believe this knowledge can help build a more personalised, achievable and balanced work routine.

In version 2.0 we plan to add a feature with prediction of how many «tomatoes» you will need for this type of tasks.

## Build status
For now project has a part UI for main pages & we are working on database (SQLite). We have 8 more milestones to go trough including but not limited to errors handling and unit tests.
Our estimate - the app will be up and running before Christmas 🎄
